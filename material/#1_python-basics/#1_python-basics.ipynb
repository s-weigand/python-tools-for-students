    "## Python in general\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language (no compiling needed), which was developed in 1989 by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and is best suited for fast development (experimenting and data exploration).\n",
    "The most common interpreter is ``CPython``, which as the name already suggests is written in C.\n",
    "For computational expansive operation, like massive simulations ``C++`` and ``FORTRAN`` are more suited languages. \n",
    "But as we will see later in this course, there are also fast solutions to do computational intensive work in Python, which can compete with and integrate ``C++`` and ``FORTRAN`` ([numpy](https://numpy.org/) / [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)).\n",
    "In Python every variable/parameter/function/class-instance is a pointer to an object, which has at least some special hidden methods (``double-underscore-``/``dunder-methods``).\n",
    "Being a pointer based language also allows python easily be dynamically typed (duck typed), which means that what was an object of one type a moment ago (i.e. variable x was a ``str``), could be any onther typee the next moment (i.e. now x is an ``int``)\n",
    "Since in Python every user is considered a ``consensual adult`` there are a lot of ways how you can ``hack around`` and overwrite even language intrinsic function."
